  <h1>
    The Abilities of a Software Engineer
  </h1>
  <body>
    From the video and the sylabus given it can be seen that being a software engineer is no small and easy task. This can be seen
    with how Mayuko originally didn't think working as a software engineer was all that much when she was in college. When she got
    into the real world however, she found out just how wrong she was about her original ideas.
    <body>
      <h2>
        Wrong Attributes of a Software Engineer
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li> Solo Working </li>
        <ul>
          <li> While she was in College most of the assignments Mayuko had done was all Solo work, but these changed when she went
            into her career. She started working with a variety of different people. </li>
          <li> She thought most of her time would be spent working by herself with the occasional interaction. </li>
          </ul>
        <li> Soft Skills Will be <b> LESS </b> Important Than Technical Skills </li>
        <ul>
          <li> Originally she thought having more technical skills in her work would be a lot better for her as a software engineer. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li> Software Engineers have this image about them thatm akes them appear to be bad with people
            or are very anti social people. </li>
            <li> Having these technical skills to solve problems seemed like the most important thing </li>
        </ul>
        <li> To be <b> SUCCESSFUL </b> You Need to be a Certain Type of Person </li>
      <ul> 
        <li> This can be seen as Software Engineers having these Stereotypes around them. Such as wearing certain clothes, or
        someone being a certain kind of person in the industry. </li>
        <li> To be a Software Developer you have to have started coding around 16 or 15 years old. </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        Real Attributes of a Software Engineer
      </h2>
<ul>
  <li> Working in Pairs or in Groups </li>
  <ul>
    <li> On our syllabus we are given the idea that we should always "Team Up" with the people around us. As well as us having the Peer
      Assessment which will give us feedback from those around us. </li>
    <li> Some examples Mayuko gives includes her and her group coming together somedays to brainstorm how it will look
      or what features to add. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Soft Skills <b> AND </b> Technical Skills Are Equal in Importance </li>
  <ul>
   <li> In our syllabus we are told to help people when needed and this is a good example as to how Soft skills are important.
     This also helps further develop our Soft Skills. </li>
    <li> Mayuko thinks that what makes a really good Software Engineer is people who <b> DO </b> have Soft Skills as they
      are working with people most of the day. </li>
    <li> Mayuko still does think that Technical skills are important, however she does state that 
      "Technical Skills can be taught, but Soft Skills are harder to teach." </li>
  </ul>
  <li> You Can Just be <b> YOURSELF </b> and Still be Successful </li> 
  <ul>
    <li> In the Syllabus it says that some students may feel they are lacking because of their technology.
    This can be seen as a good example as to why it is okay to be "yourself" and still be successful. </li>
    <li> Another way of looking at the previouslt mentioned Syllabus page is where the Syllabus is saying
     how you do not need to be high and mighty to be successful. </li>
    <li> Mayuko however says you can just be yourself and who you want to be while still being a Software Engineer. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> <b> ROLE MODELS </b> </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In our Syllabus it states that "75 is Average" allowing those who step up to the plate to be these Role Models
    Mayuka talked about in her interview. </li>
  </ul>
</ul>
      <h3> Important Terms to Know </h3>
      <dl>
        <dt> Soft Skills </dt>
        <dd> Soft skills includes <b> People </b> skills, <b> Social </b> skills, and <b> Communication </b> skills. </dd>

        <dd> <a "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uOA-kzolTFWs9eUftw3o8SZX7LM_w8cy9kj9h3g6pZE/edit"> 
          The Syllabus of Mr. Bradshaw </a> </dd>
      </dl>
      <h3> Additional Topic Idea </h3>
      <ul>
        <li> Explore All the Different Things You Can Do </li>
  <ul>
    <li> In class we talked about how we won't just be given the answer. How we should get help from others and further
    utilize other resources to see how far we can go. This is a similar concept to the idea of being able to
    Explore Different Things. </li>
  </ul>
