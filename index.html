    The Abilities of a Software Engineer
  </h1>
  <body>
    From the video and the sylabus given it can be seen that being a software engineer is no small and easy task. This can be seen
    with how Mayuko originally didn't think working as a software engineer was all that much when she was in college. When she got
    into the real world however, she found out just how wrong she was about her original ideas.

      <ul>
        <li> Solo Working </li> //list 1
        <ul>
          <li> While she was in College most of the assignments Mayuko had done was all Solo work, but these changed when she went
            into her career. She started working with a variety of different people. </li>
          <li> She thought most of her time would be spent working by herself with the occasional interaction. </li>
          </ul>
        <li> Soft Skills Will be <b> LESS </b> Important Than Technical Skills </li>
        <ul>
          Originally she thought having more technical skills in her work would be a lot better for her as a software engineer.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Having these technical skills to solve problems seemed like the most important thing
